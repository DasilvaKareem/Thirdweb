Hackathon Project: Wi-Fi Sensor Integration with ThirdWeb Smart Contract
Overview
This repository houses the code for our hackathon project, where we integrate a Wi-Fi sensor with ThirdWeb's smart contract. Our goal is to capture MAC addresses and their corresponding signal strengths (RSSI) using a Wi-Fi sensor and securely store this data on the blockchain via ThirdWeb's tools and infrastructure.

Problem Statement
In today's digital age, data privacy and security are paramount concerns. Traditional centralized data storage solutions are vulnerable to breaches and hacks. Our project aims to address this issue by leveraging blockchain technology to securely store sensitive Wi-Fi sensor data in a decentralized manner.

Solution
Hardware Setup
We utilize Arduino boards (ESP32 or ESP8266) along with Wi-Fi modules to capture MAC addresses and RSSI values of nearby Wi-Fi devices. The hardware setup is simple and cost-effective, making it accessible for various applications.

Software Configuration
Our code integrates with Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB) for additional data storage and retrieval capabilities. We also leverage ThirdWeb's smart contract deployment tools to deploy a secure smart contract on the blockchain network.

ThirdWeb Integration
ThirdWeb provides essential infrastructure for deploying and interacting with smart contracts. We use ThirdWeb's tools to:

Deploy a secure smart contract on the blockchain network, ensuring data integrity and immutability.
Interface with the deployed smart contract, enabling seamless data push from the Wi-Fi sensor to the blockchain.
Functionality
Data Collection: The Wi-Fi sensor captures MAC addresses and RSSI values using Wi-Fi promiscuous mode. Each data pair is stored locally in the Arduino's memory.

Data Push to Smart Contract: At regular intervals, the sensor pushes the collected data to the ThirdWeb smart contract. The data is formatted according to the contract's requirements and sent as transactions to the contract address.

Firebase Integration: In addition to blockchain storage, the sensor updates a Firebase RTDB with the collected data for redundancy and ease of access.

Usage
Upload the provided sensor code to your Arduino board.
Ensure proper hardware setup and Wi-Fi module connection.
Monitor the serial output to verify data capture by the sensor.
Check the Firebase RTDB for stored data and monitor the ThirdWeb smart contract address for incoming transactions.
Future Improvements
Enhance data encryption and privacy measures to further secure sensitive information.
Explore deeper integration with ThirdWeb's ecosystem, such as utilizing their decentralized storage solutions for enhanced data security.
Implement data analytics and visualization tools to derive insights from collected data.
